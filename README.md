# ðŸš€ 30 Days DevOps Challenge

Iâ€™m taking on this **30 Days DevOps Challenge** to **strengthen my knowledge, sharpen my hands-on skills, and build a solid foundation in DevOps**.  
Over the next 30 days, Iâ€™ll be working through practical topics in **Linux, Git, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Monitoring, and Automation** â€” documenting my progress along the way.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Challenge?
DevOps is not just about tools â€” itâ€™s about **mindset, workflows, and automation**.  
This challenge is my way of:
- Revisiting the **core fundamentals** I already know
- Filling in **gaps in my knowledge**
- Building **real, portfolio-worthy projects**
- Getting comfortable with **end-to-end DevOps workflows**
